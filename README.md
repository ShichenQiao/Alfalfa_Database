# Alfalfa_Database
This repository is used to store the product applications and scripts used during the development process of Project Alfalfa Database developed by Shichen (Justin) Qiao and Chen Shen. Since we do not have the right to post the original dataset or the resulting SQL database file, some static resources were replaced by "readme.txt" in the application folders.

Directory web_application stores the Web Application based on the Flask Framework.

Directory commandline_application stores the command line user interface of our database.

Directory backend_scripts stores the major Python, Java, and SQL scripts used to construct Alfalfa.db
