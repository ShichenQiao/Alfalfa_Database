This repository is used to store the product applications and scripts used during the development process of Project Alfalfa Database developed by Shichen (Justin) Qiao and Chen Shen. Since we are not authorized to post the original dataset or the resulting SQL database file, some static resources were replaced by "readme.txt" in the application folders.
